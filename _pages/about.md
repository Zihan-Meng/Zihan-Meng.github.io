I am now a PhD candidate from The University of Hong Kong,[Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.](https://www.eee.hku.hk/study/rpg/) I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Houyun He](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~yhhou/index.htm), and my research area is about renewable energy and Inverter-based Resources.

I am a fan of fashion designs, movies and musics. I am also a authorized musician in [NetEase Music](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=34602529)
